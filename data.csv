Leaf_smut,"Mainly caused by fungi like Leptosphaeria sacchari.

","Characterized by the formation of black, powdery spore masses on leaves. Lesions often appear irregularly shaped and can coalesce.",Primarily spread through spores produced by infected plants. Rain and water splashes facilitate spore dispersal.,Warm and humid conditions promote disease development. Excessive moisture and crowded planting can create favorable environments.,"Reduces photosynthetic efficiency, affecting plant growth.
Can lead to yield losses and poor grain quality.
","Use of resistant rice varieties can be an effective strategy. seed treatment and rotation with non-host crops help control the disease.
